Steps to break down an Algo

1) Read the problem twice, and underline any key words that mean something (given, return)
2) Think about how you would do the problem in ENGLISH (use items around your house?)
3) Think: Does my computer need anything additional to accomplish this?
4) Using steps 1-3, try to write the tasks that your computer needs to do, breaking down as much as possible (don't worry about order)
5) Try to find an order to these tasks from step 4, using more programming words
6) Using the English list from step 4, and the more code-oriented list from step 5, try to write the algorithm, crossing off tasks on both lists as you write them in code
7) Once you finish writing the algo, make a T-diagram and check your work
8) Doesn't hurt to try a couple different iterations/test cases
9) Did you consider edge cases? (BONUS)
